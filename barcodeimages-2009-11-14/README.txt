Class BarcodeImages
20091114

Hi, happy to write to you.

BarcodeImages requires at least one "Barcode TTF Font" to work.
Since www.phpclasses.org NOT allow to upload Binary Files into the class files,
then I published a LINK in BarcodeImages Class page 

[http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/5789.html]

to download the package from my site.

Please download the file from 
[http://e-ssence.net/hectorhuergo/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/barcodefonts.zip]

Then extract the folder fonts into the BarcodeImages class folder, ie:

/barcodeimages/fonts or /www/barcodeimages/fonts

Please read the lines 38 and 41 of the file barcode.class.php.
As you can see, the class finds the folder ./fonts (and the TTF file into this)
from the folder that includes himself.

If you have any trouble, please write me: h4 at e-ssence dot net

Thanks.

H4
